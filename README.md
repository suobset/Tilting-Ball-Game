CICS 256 Project


Use the readme as a place for brainstorming and just jotting down ideas rn. Make edits, commit straight. 

Can be done straight from browser. Let's try to use markdown features to organize as well. 

This will be archived and replaced with an actual ReadMe with all presentable details once project is done. 

Can make basic website via GitHub Pages as well, but let's not think about that rn.
